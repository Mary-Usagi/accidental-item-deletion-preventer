# Accidental Item Deletion Preventer

Did you spend a full hour customizing your item, adding a perfect description, animations and maybe even sounds... just to accidentally press the delete button and having to redo everything? 

Not anymore!

### This module adds a confirmation dialogue before deleting stuff
* When you click on `Delete Item` or `Delete Effect` from the character sheet, a confirmation dialogue will appear before deleting the item. 
* For a quantity of more than one for an item, you can decide how many you want to delete. 
* Can be enabled/disabled from the settings.
